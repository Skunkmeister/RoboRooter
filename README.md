## Overview
RoboRouter is a senior project undertaken to navigate challenging terrains by emphasizing the role of terrain color texture over surface geometry in making pathfinding decisions, developed as part of the CIS4914 under the supervision of Dr. Alexandre Gomes de Siqueira.

## Project Team
- **Preston Barney** - Project Manager/Embedded Developer
- **Manas Pandey** - Scrum Master/Embedded Developer
- **Michael Tomadakis** - Computer Vision Engineer
- **Sagan Potenza** - Computer Vision Engineer
- **Yosef Melul** - Frontend Developer

## Technology Stack
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: Used for managing robot behavior through a modular framework.
- **Python**: Primary language for both ROS, simulation, and the Blender API.
- **React**: Frontend framework.
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**: Provides the computational power necessary for processing visual data and running AI models.

## Acknowledgments
- Dr. Alexandre Gomes de Siqueira, for his continuous support and guidance.
- Sahaj Patel, for his contributions to the project's initial concepts.
